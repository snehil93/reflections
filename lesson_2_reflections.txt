What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When i initialize a repository i need to type git init in the directory i want to create my repository in. It will give me the message that a git repository has been initialised 
at the current directory. Then typing git status will show me the number of files in my directory as untracked as well as tell me initial commit and on branch master.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the intermediate stage provided by git wher u can put your files which you want to commit before making the actual commit. 
It is valuable as it allows us to make a choice as to which files in the repository we want to be tracked by git and which ones we want to keep out. 


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can place the file in which i made the logical change in the staging area and make the commit giving an apropriate commit message.
then i can make a seperate commit for a different logical change 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?


Branches are helpful when i want to implement some new sometimes experimental feature in my project whose pregress is to be tracked parallely but seperately wrt my main project
in such situations branches can be useful.
