What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When i initialize a repository i need to type git init in the directory i want to create my repository in. It will give me the message that a git repository has been initialised 
at the current directory. Then typing git status will show me the number of files in my directory as untracked as well as tell me initial commit and on branch master.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the intermediate stage provided by git wher u can put your files which you want to commit before making the actual commit. 
It is valuable as it allows us to make a choice as to which files in the repository we want to be tracked by git and which ones we want to keep out.
